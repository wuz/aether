        <strong>Download and verify integrity with GnuPG:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Import my keys (you can verify keybase.io/wuz as me by visiting the site!)
            <code>curl https://keybase.io/wuz/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import</code></li>
          <li>Open up GPG and let it know that you trust my keys (0xCAA69BFC5EF24C40 is my key)
            <code>gpg --edit-key 0xCAA69BFC5EF24C40</code>
            <code>trust</code>
            <li>At this point, you need to decide how much you trust me, represented from 1-5
              You probably don't trust me ultimately - that should just be reserved for you.
              If, in looking at my keybase, you think I am pretty trustworthy, you can set my trust level to 4.
              You can read more about what each trust level means <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html">here</a>
              <code> 4</code></li>
          </li>
          <li>Recieve the keys from a keyserver
            <code>gpg --recv-keys 0xCAA69BFC5EF24C40</code></li>
          <li>Verify that this code is actually signed by me. Don't forget, `https` is really important here!
            <code> curl https://setup.wuz.sh | gpg -o setup.wuz.sh</code></li>
        </ol>

        Don't pipe to `sh` in the previous step -
        you don't know if the signature is valid
        or what the source code is doing.

        <strong>Inspect source code</strong>
        <code> less setup.wuz.sh</code>

        <strong>Run</strong>
        <code> chmod +x setup.wuz.sh</code>
        <code> ./setup.wuz.sh</code>
